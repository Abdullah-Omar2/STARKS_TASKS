the output: Before calling the function, a = 5 and b = 6
            Inside function *n1 = 6, *n2 = 26
			after calling the function, a = 6 and b = 26
	
in the first line the origin values of a and b are printed because the function isn't called yet.

then we pass the addresses of a and b to the function to be stored in pointers n1 and n2 then we increase the value in address
of a by 1 and increase the value in address of b by 20 and print the new values in the second line but inside the function.

then we return to the main function and print a and b and new values will be printed because thier values changed in the function
because we use passing by reference.
